Chat - you can use it to exchange text messages.

Classes:

- Server - the main class of the server, the application is launched from it
- MessageType - enum, which is responsible for the type of messages sent between

client and server
- Message - the class responsible for forwarded messages
- Connection - the class of connection between the client and the server
- ConsoleHelper - a helper class for reading or writing to the console

Highlights of the client-server communication protocol:
- When a new client wants to connect to the server, the server should ask for a name

client.
- When the client receives a name request from the server he must send his name

server.
- When the server receives the client's name, it must accept this name or request

new.
- When a new client is added to the chat, the server should inform the others

to the participants about the new client.
- When the client leaves the chat, the server should inform the rest of the participants about it.
- When the server receives a text message from the client, it should forward it

all other chat participants.

The Connection class acts as a wrapper over the java.net.Socket class,
which is able to serialize and deserialize objects of type Message into a socket.

Each participant receives information about the other participants when he enters the chat.

There is also a bot in the application that can give information about the date.
Understands commands: date, day, month, year, time, hour, minutes, seconds.
